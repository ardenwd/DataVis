# Labs

This repository is designed to help you learn the skills needed to create data visualizations on the web. Through this lab, you will learn how to program with the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) toolkit. D3 has become the go-to tool for creating interactive visualizations. D3 leverages existing web technologies in order to bring your interactive visualizations to a global audience via the Web.

Lab Instructions can be found on this repository's Wiki (click tab above). 

### Reading Materials

The labs will generally follow Scott Murray's [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book-2e). In the *Prerequisites* section of each lab we will list the accompanying chapter or section of the Murray book.
