    "lyrics": "Hard to read, you could be OCD\nYou could be bad for me, you could say anything\nSometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights\nLittle afraid to say\nYou know the things that make me smile\nThe face I make before my tears fall down\nThe things that I feel when you're acting suspicious\nYou know the place I run to hide\nI take my problems there to work \u2019em out\n\nThe things that I say when you don't wanna listen\nThings that you say when I make bad decisions\nThings that we do by the sink in my kitchen\nI remember our first date\nNo chocolate and no bouquet\nBut the way that you kissed me\nThese are the things that could make us official\n\nLook at us, isn't it obvious?\nIs it so dangerous? Is it so complicated?\nYou know the shapes my body makes\nUnder the sheets at 4 AM with you\nThe things that we break when we\u2019re switchin' positions\nYou know the words to my mistakes\nYou understand because you made 'em too\nYou might also like\nThe things that I say when you don't wanna listen\nThings that you say when I make bad decisions\nThings that we do by the sink in my kitchen\nI remember our first date\nNo chocolate and no bouquet\nBut the way that you kissed me\nThese are the things that could make us official\n\nAll of the things that we sometimes forget\nAll of the dreams that you put in my head\nI'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed\nThese are the things that could make us official\nMaybe the sky might not always be blue\nAll of my wishes will never come true\nIt doesn't matter 'cause I\u2019m here with you\nThis stuff could make us official\nSo tell all your friends \u2019cause we're goin\u2019 official\n\nThings that you say when I make bad decisions\nThings that we do by the sink in my kitchen\nI remember our first date\nNo chocolate and no bouquet\nBut the way that you kissed me\nThese are the things that could make us official\nThese are the things that could make us official\nThese are the things that could make us official\nI remember our first date\nNo chocolate and no bouquet\nBut the way that you kissed me\nThese are the things that could make us official"
